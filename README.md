# FHGR Neuroscience Hackathon

## Ideas
- Jaw clench
  - (1) Add curre~~~~nt song to some playlist (Spotify API)
- Emotional state
  - (2) Skip song based on negative response in EEG

## Project 1
- Jaw clench algorithm unclear
- Real time data with SDK unclear
- Spotify API
  - Get current song
  - Write song to configured playlist
- Visualize data
  - Vertical line at jaw clench
- GUI?

## Project 2
- Get EEG data for training
- Get realtime feed
- Interpret feed with trained model
- Control song
